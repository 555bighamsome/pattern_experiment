                <p><strong>Principal investigator:</strong> Bonan Zhao</p>
                <p><strong>Researcher collecting data:</strong> Pinzhe Zhao</p>
                <p><em>This study was certified according to the Informatics Research Ethics Process, reference number 359440. Please take time to read the following information carefully. You should keep this page for your records.</em></p>
                
                <h3>Who are the researchers?</h3>
                <p>PI: Bonan Zhao &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student: Pinzhe Zhao</p>
                
                <h3>What is the purpose of the study?</h3>
                <p>This project aims to study how people use basic shapes and operations to solve visual pattern problems, revealing the cognitive processes behind compositional reasoning in computational cognitive science.</p>
                
                <h3>Why have I been asked to take part?</h3>
                <p>This study is open to any adult with normal vision. There are no special requirements.</p>
                
                <h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>
                <p>No – participation in this study is entirely up to you. You can withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason. Your rights will not be affected. If you wish to withdraw, contact the PI. We will stop using your data in any publications or presentations submitted after you have withdrawn consent. However, we will keep copies of your original consent, and of your withdrawal request.</p>
                
                <h3>What will happen if I decide to take part?</h3>
                <p>If you decide to participate, you will be asked to complete a series of tasks related to decision-making, pattern identification, and reasoning. You will provide responses to questions regarding your judgments on patterns, probabilities, and causal relationships. Data will be collected through interactive online tasks, including written responses to prompts. The session will last approximately 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>Your participation will not involve any audio or video recording. The study will be conducted entirely online, and you can complete it at a time that is convenient for you.</p>
                
                <h3>Compensation</h3>
                <p>You will be paid £10 for your participation in this study.</p>
                
                <h3>Are there any risks associated with taking part?</h3>
                <p>There are no significant risks associated with participation.</p>
                
                <h3>Are there any benefits associated with taking part?</h3>
                <p>While there are no direct benefits beyond compensation for your participation, this research aims to enhance our understanding of human cognition, which could contribute to the development of automated systems capable of solving complex problems that humans can easily address with minimal guidance.</p>
                
                <h3>What will happen to the results of this study?</h3>
                <p>The results of this study may be summarised in published articles, reports and presentations. Quotes or key findings will be anonymized: We will remove any information that could, in our assessment, allow anyone to identify you. With your consent, information can also be used for future research. Your data may be archived for a minimum of two years.</p>
                
                <h3>Data protection and confidentiality</h3>
                <p>Your data will be processed in accordance with Data Protection Law. All information collected about you will be kept strictly confidential. Your data will be referred to by a unique participant number rather than by name. Your data will only be viewed by the researcher/research team.</p>
                <p>All electronic data will be stored on a password-protected encrypted computer, on the School of Informatics' secure file servers, or on the University's secure encrypted cloud storage services (DataShare, ownCloud, or Sharepoint) and all paper records will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in the PI's office. Your consent information will be kept separately from your responses in order to minimise risk.</p>
